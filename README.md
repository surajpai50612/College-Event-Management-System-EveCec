# College Event Management System (EveCec)

• The **“College Event Management System”** aims at the maintenance and management of the events data and providing opportunities for students to register to these events online. 
<br /><br />• The system we have implemented manages different objectives like students can sign up to our website, students can register for the events of particular category whose registration data will be stored in separate tables based on category, students can view winners information of particular events, admin privilege for adding, updating, deleting events and winner information.
<br /><br />• Each of these accesses a database schema which has corresponding tables.<br/><br/>
